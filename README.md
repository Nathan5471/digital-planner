# Digital Planner

## About

This is a digital planner that is meant to be used by students. It supports different event types like homework, test, quiz, project, and no school. It will also sync across devices through the backend using the account you create.

## Technologies

Frontend: The frontend is a Vite app that uses React. For styling, TailwindCSS was used.
Backend: For the backend, Express JS was used along with MongoDB for storing events and user information.

## Usage

The planner has a weekly view where you are able to view, manage, and create events. You can also easily see upcoming tests, quizzes, and projects on the right side of the week view. There is also a button to go to the settings page below the upcoming section.
